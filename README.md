I got bored once again, so I made a very simple and little project with some node.js server so as to get more familiar with this.
So yes those kind of projects are kind common but I like to make my own version because it's just fun when you have nothing to do.

Very simple project:
- 1/6 chances to get shoot and get your C:\Windows deleted (as every

Main interface:

Once the button is clicked, you can get 2 different messages:

- the one when you obtain a value from 1 to 5:

and the one when you get 6, and you don't want to get that one:

How to make it works (that's for those who don't usually get used to those tools obviously):

First thing is, having Node.js installed: https://nodejs.org/

Then, launch your command prompt and check if this is donwloaded by typing this:

and you should get:

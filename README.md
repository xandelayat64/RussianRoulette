# RussianRoulette

I got bored once again, so I made a very simple and little project with some node.js server so as to get more familiar with this.
So yes those kind of projects are kind common but I like to make my own version because it's just fun when you have nothing to do.

Very simple project:
- 1/6 chances to get shoot and get your C:\Windows deleted (as every

Main interface:

Once the button is clicked, you can get 2 different messages:

- the one when you obtain a value from 1 to 5:

and the one when you get 6, and you don't want to get that one:

How to make it works (that's for those who don't usually get used to those tools obviously):


First thing is, having Node.js installed: https://nodejs.org/


Secondly, launch your command prompt and check if this is donwloaded by typing this:

and you should get:

Then, go to the path were you downloaded the RussianRoulette (cd 'path') project in the cmd and run the command below, to launch the server:

and you should get this in the command prompt (that message I did set):

<img width="761" height="44" alt="Capture d&#39;écran 2025-11-30 182456" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76af485a-4860-496f-9487-cb9c88be8d30" />


CTRL + click on the link and you should get to the HTML page.
Now you can finally, (maybe) delete your Windows folder !
